# SMBZ-Collab-On-3DS
Out of fun and boredom, I decided to port the Super Mario Bros Z Episode 6 Reanimated Collab, a collab that I was one of the hosts for, on the Nintendo 3DS, with a new custom banner and icon! Being my first time hackking a 3DS file, I had fun making this, and I hope you all will enjoy my efforts!
